# RDS_decode

RDS is a digital communication protocol that is used to send information such as song titles and program identification 
data along with FM radio broadcast. This is a project to implement the physical layer and the data-link layer of the 
RDS protocol. It is more exploratory than functional, so if you are just looking for a quick way to decode you should use something else (eg. [redsea](https://github.com/windytan/redsea))
